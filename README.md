# my first attempt at game development

### game created for [my first game winter jam]https://itch.io/jam/my-first-game-jam-winter-2021/community) on itch.io

It was the first time I worked with a game engine, so most of it was just figuring Godot, additionally I wanted to code in C# (which works in Godot, but is not the default. So it's harder to find C# tutorial)
It resulted with a not perfect code and not finished game, so don't bother looking too much into this files.

I'm leaving it here mostly for future references for myself, and when I come back to this concept I'll probably start with a fresh file
